## Overview

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol that enables asynchronous serial data transmission, meaning no shared clock signal is required between the sender and receiver. The UART peripheral facilitates serial communication between the FPGA and external devices. This document outlines the UART peripheralâ€™s functionality, key features, configuration options, usage instructions, and support resources.

## Configuration

To configure the UART peripheral, user has to pass configuration frame which is mentioned below to update the value of the configuration register of UART 

    
1. `BAUD_RATE`: It Specifies the baud rate for serial communication. Buad rate defines the number of bits transfer per second. For example if baud-rate is 9600 means 9600 bits transfer in one second. To configure the baud rate of uart we have to pass the value of clk_per_bit as the configuration value which can be calculated as per above formula -

    ```
    Formula :
        clks per bit = (system clk) / (baud rate)
    ```
    clock per bit defines the number of clock counts for each bit transfer
    
    Example:

    Configuration frame :
    Let's assume the system clk frequency is 50MHz and the slave id of uart is 1,the configuration id to configure baud-rate is 0, and we want to configure it to run on baud rate of 115200 bps. 
    hence,
    ```
        clks_per_bit = 50000000/115200
        clks_per_bit = 434 = 0x1B2
    ```
    Thus, the configuration register will be -
    ```
    00 00 01 B2
    ```

> **_NOTE:_**  It is mandatory to configure the parameters after uploading or refreshing the bitstream into the FPGA. By default value of all the configuration register will be 0.

## Data Frame
Example:

Data frame :
To write 4 bytes (0x41 0x42 0x43 0x44) on uart -
```
41 42 43 44
```

## Usage
**Data Transmission and Reception**: UART transmit and receive interfaces used to send and receive data over the serial interface.

## Support

This documentation provides an overview of the UART peripheral, including its features, configuration options, usage guidelines, and support information.
